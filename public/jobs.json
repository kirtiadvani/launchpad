    "description": "<p>Boxaroo is a rapidly growing business that is automating the global $140bn Promotional Products industry. We work with clients like Google, Spotify, Visa and so on to produce company_name swag and company_name merchandise for them. We make it easier for them to do this by removing all the friction involved in sourcing and producing their company_name swag. But it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t end there \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we also provide automated fulfilment and warehousing services to go with it, so they can store all their swag with us and ship it anywhere in the world, as and when they need, without lifting a finger. This saves them costs, time, and plenty of headaches as our existing clients will tell you. Boxaroo has offices and warehouses in Singapore and Spain, and has plans to open more globally. We prefer the long-term over the short-term. We maintain unreasonably high standards. We are customer obsessed. We want to be the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest swag company_name, and we aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stopping until we get there.<\/p><p><br \/><\/p><p><strong>YOUR ROLE<\/strong><\/p><p>In this fully remote role, you will play the role of a hunter (in Sales speak) to identify, connect, nurture and close deals with medium to large companies to automate all their swag needs with us. This means clients you sell to will use Boxaroo to create, store and fulfill all their company_name swag and corporate merchandise needs \u00e2\u0080\u0093 regionally or globally. (For example: one client you sell to will produce 1000 New Hire Kits with Boxaroo, which we will store in our warehouses and ship out to their new employees as and when they join the client's company_name. The size of such a deal could be between 100-150K+. Another client could produce all the marketing merch they need for events throughout the year and store it with Boxaroo. We will then ship it out as and when they need it, anywhere in the world. The size of this deal could be between 100-300K+.) While some guideline and support will be provided on strategy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the role of identifying leads, and then establishing a connection with decision-makers, and selling to them will be carried out by you single-handedly. So naturally, this task requires a self-starter who has worked in a similar role, knows all the tools of the trade, and can take on complete ownership from Day One. In the last 2 years, we have built a sound business model, a strong Logistics system, and a capable Supply Chain system \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we are ready to scale all of that, and we want a Sales Leader who can realize its potential.<\/p><p><br \/><\/p><p><strong>COMPENSATION<\/strong><\/p><ul><li>Base salary: about USD 2K per month. Will be substantially more (USD 3K-6K+) after 4-6 months based on performance.<\/li><li>Uncapped commissions with a potential to reach upwards of USD 30K+ every quarter.<br \/><\/li><\/ul><p>\u00e2\u0080\u008d<\/p><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS<\/strong><\/p><ul><li>4+ years of selling into HR or Marketing teams with an annual quota in the seven-figure range.<\/li><li>Track record of over-achieving quotas in past titles.<\/li><li>Relentless perseverance to reach decision-makers, build trust, and identify solutions for their swag needs.<\/li><li>A growth mindset is very important. Be willing to learn and grow every day, and enjoy challenges that come your way.<\/li><li>Strong communication skills, analytical skills and listening skills \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with a positive and energetic video-call presence.<\/li><li>You will work primarily in European CET hours.<\/li><\/ul><p><br \/><\/p><p><strong>PERKS<\/strong><\/p><ul><li>Travel to Singapore and Spain (only if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to \u00e2\u0080\u0093 since you can be remote).<\/li><li>Join us at a time when you can help shape the future of the company_name.<\/li><li>Unlimited Annual Leave \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we are all adults, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in control!<\/li><li>Plenty of amazing swag.<\/li><li>Engaging activities outside of work.<\/li><li>Being part of an organization that rewards results and truly believes in promoting from within \u00e2\u0080\u0093 your growth potential is uncapped.<\/li><\/ul><br\/><br\/>Please mention the word **WISELY** and tag RMTIyLjE2Ny42Ni4yMg== when applying to show you read the job post completely (#RMTIyLjE2Ny42Ni4yMg==).

Today, mortgage lenders are stuck running their companies on software products built 20 years ago. These products are slow and unstable, and end up costing lenders millions of dollars in other otherwise preventable mistakes every year. LoanCrate solves those problems and more, helping lenders improve the home-buying experience for people all over the country.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Since starting in January 2021, our remote team has raised $9m, grown to 15 people, and launched our first product. And since adopting LoanCrate in June '21, our customers have used LoanCrate to power &gt;$50 billion in new home loans. As a company_name, we're on track to be cash-flow positive in 2023.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Our team is a group of people excited to tackle the complexity of the home-lending industry. We care about collaboration, very open communication covering the good &amp; the bad so that we learn from our decisions quickly, and ultimately having fun while we're building. You'll fit in well if you like diving deep quickly!<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div><strong>The opportunity<\/strong><\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>Our dreams are big and we have much to build! We're looking for senior software engineers to help lead our team in powering the future of home buying in the US (which could entail managing a majority of US home loans every year \u00e2\u0080\u0094 financial assets worth trillions of dollars).<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>We are excited to offer competitive salary and equity for this role.<\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div><strong>What to expect<\/strong><\/div><div><br \/><\/div><div>As an engineer at LoanCrate, you'll continue our team tradition by shipping code to production on your first day!
